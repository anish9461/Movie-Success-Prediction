MovieSuccessPrediction
======================
Description:

A machine learning project to predict if a movie is going to be a blockbuster or flop. In this project we aim to collect data from various sources like Twitter and Youtube comments, and perform classification of postivity of these tweets and comments. Our model uses these values to predict success of a movie in the scale of 1 to 5, where 5 being blockbuster and 1 being flop. Various classification algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy are implemented and accuracy is compared. We uses Python as primary language of implementation.
