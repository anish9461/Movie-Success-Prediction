"dude!! one cannot say a film is similar because the story is based on similar concepts!! if its is like that, then for u apthamitra will have resemblance to anniyan, right? but its utterly false. so think maadi boss"
niceeeeeeeeeee

"my story!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i took atarax tablet; hydroxyzine for my itchy reddish, irritating skin as a treatment schedule, after 2-3 days i was getting dreams of my relatives like brother and sister were died, on alternate days, means one day my brother died, another day my sister was died, that was unbelievable dreams made me to believe after dreams also to be like true"
"so i was scared like any thing. then i went my native, there all are healthy and alive i found the same. thank god after watching this movie, i came to the side effects of hydroxine tablet study about other drugs of psychiatry, make one more lucia as lucia 2 bye thanks"
lucia is my own experience what i saw in theatre' great movie. jai karnataka
hey boss please watch memento and shutter island also...will explain all three together

"brilliant kannada movie. after 2 yrs saw a kannada movie and really happy to see. first time to see a kannada movie where its only movie. please make such brilliant movies more. for sure i am going to watch it 3 times. hat's of to the director and the story writer specially. please encourage such writers more , kannada films will grow more."
hat's off to the director
hats of to the director
great job director..
"liked the movie a lot. i just found that it draws inspiration from limitless, inception & memento. but producing such a technically sound movie with the low budget is really a huge challenge. hats off pawan kumar..."
i watched this twice and will definitely go once more!!
"i really dedicated to this to film to myself......... i appreciate this film, he is history maker.."
"just now i read about this movie in the hindu, being a telugu person i want to learn kannada to touch the soul of the movie"
pls some1 explain the movie last 15 mins my id amguruprasath1996AT_USER the climax i dint get to kno..pls
"draws a lot of inspiration from memento and inception (both nolan movies).. however, that doesn't undermine the direction and cinematography.. the script is entirely local (that cannot be copied from a hollywood movie) drawing inspiration from great movies and applying it to a whole new specific story - is a fantastic achievement... magnificent direcction, good acting.. and a well knit plot."
movie is fully based on kanakadasa's keerthane. i think tat man had seen god in dream & it as cum true.....
concept seems almost similar to inception but i hope u have researched about lucid dreams n u synchronized da story in indian style!! very good direction bro its not tat easy to handle this kinda tough stories im happy u did it! n i loved it :) congrats :)
totaly i like sathishaaa... because we expect more sathishaaa...from drama days ..&i hope our naturel hero dont dis oppointed me so this sunday i go with my family ... & best of luck to our satheeshaaa ..& also the director should take more risk over satheshaa but sir dont worry u realy reached the goal... .....
i felt very happy movie released in pune...i watched nice movie...thank you for giving good movie for kannada industry
"guru movie super but ond doubt,producer mathu co producer hesaru torsbekare sumaru 150 jana idru(audience movie),but movie turnover yarige???"
good movie ... first its kind of movie in kannada . great creativity also you can see in the movie. but i guess he taken inspiriation from inception movie thats lead to u & hero confusion about dream & reality.
"by the looks of it... the story is based on a hollywood movie starring christian bale ""the machinist"". need to watch and decide."
well at the beginning you'd get a feeling that it resembles 'the machinist'. pretty much his sleeplessness and hallucinations. yet to watch it though!
"inception? lol, dude, grow up!"
awesome... nyc movie...everyone must watch...
great pawan. hope nimma fountain head of creativity keeps doling out such gems. congrats on a great movie!
the best thing about the film was not the twist or different concept but the art of fusion of nativity into it very well done without going for out and out influence of other concept films which makes it stand on its own.
i won't mind a massage.
awesome movie. must watch ! kudos to the lucia team it can be compared to inception !! :)
"i hope this will b a good movie, which gives a good massage to people, good luck to loosia team.........."
buying the music now. will watch the movie too and i hope it runs for a long time :) all the best!
good trailer
nyc trailer...hope hit d screens soon...!!
sakathagide wating for pavans direction..
have u seen figh club properly chetan kumar in tat movie the protagonist who suffers from insomnia creates another personality and so he goes on a rampage but this movie as u see in trailer is related to drugs n sutff
i am not sure of thought process or anything like that but if its a copy then it doesnt deserve any credit..just because a student worked hard in the exam hall to copy others answer doesnt mean he deserves the end result !!!!
i'm waiting fr this movie............... 
looks good. waiting for the movie.
"well, i don't see the air that needs to cleared. the english movie you mentioned here are two great movie. but comparing them with manasaare and lucia doesn't justify ones hard work. may be the movie carries same essence and idea from english movie but bringing a parallelism takes a lot of hard work, creativity and huge thought process, especially when the audience are different."
"very good experiment, i hope your experiment will cure the audience pain in some extent.. good work mr.pavan"
request you not to make ppl wait too much... u knw wt hpnd to h2o ..
pavan kumarAT_USER r d god gift for kannada industry.... we need innovator not a remaker
hey niz trailer bro nd nangnsutte idu hangover movie-du story tarane irbahudu anta!!!!
"if u mean d split personality used frm fight club ... then its already been used in psycho ...that is not exactly what fc is cult for...its usp was its radical social msg , which nobody was very comfortable with when it was released.... even the book met with same fate i suppose ...but it was received well later on ... as for presentation of the movie it seem more draw towards documentary style(film festivals)..i do agree its nt unique..bt its gd 2 c such a mov in kannada"
sandalwood seems to be changing for good...gr8
please release the movie in hyderabad and chennai also.

"many of rehman's tracks resembles many english album, dude. once in an interview, cyrus broacha asked abt it to rehman, his reply was, if he had not follow or add such copied tunes, he wudn't be 'a.r. rehman' wat we r seeing him. djs mix the different music for remix, he'll be success only when he knows 'what to remix, how to remix..etc'. so, just take it if it sounds gud. dats it. if times come, if required, he'll reveal :-). \m/"
amazing trailor director boss hope to see movie first show in main theatre
hi... pawan please try 2 release in dubai.........
sir icant sleep realese the movie.........
"in what way did you find manasaare similar to 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' ? the basic plot of the movie itself is totally different. and coming to this trailer, come on this is just a trailer. having 'insomnia' as a concept doesn't mean it is similar to fight club. anyways, now since the movie is being screened at liff, definitely it cant have any similarity to fight club :)"
"superb ! i like the trailer, want to watch full movie but in english or hindi dubbed, is it possible ?"
amazing trailer ... hope to see this movie in theatre 
sir i want to work with u sir .. my cont no : 8880959541

"pawan tamma pratibhe node tumba khushi agtide, technically and yist talent an kannada film inds ge dedicate madirodu yinnu grate.. really we fedup with current kannada movie.. other than some good ones,like uppi's, yogaraj, guruprasad.. thanks for new dimension in kannada,"

keep watching and encouraging our movies......
true that....
"i've seen fightclub,machinist.there's no resemblence except insomnia....."
"hi chethan, even i feel the same. this looks to be simiar to fight club, hope director pavan has seen that movie. hope director pavan clarifies this..."
good.............. 
"great job sir... we r having a lot of hopes on u, your earlier movie lifu ishtene was also a creative n experimental movie. great going, our support r always with u...."
ur the great director
super making i like ur movie
good point raghu. internet annodhu mangana kaige maanikya kottangaagidhe. enuu maadakkaagalla strange thing is 5 people even liked his comment

"watch the sequel : after_lucia , spanish movie ! :p juz kidding.. respect !!"
super pavan....
2:00 a siddi in the movie!!!!! after a long time.. i guess the last one was in boothayana maga ayyu.. good job by giving chances to them
the only link between fight club and this movie is insomnia .. if that is the case i am brad pitt !!! :d i guess its in no way similar ! but would really love it if kannada movie makers would watch such movies and get an inspiration from it than to watch the cheap telugu and hindi movies and remake em ...
vishwanath.987kiranAT_USER
soooo far ....... so good......
dude i watched fight club as well.there's no similarity....lets wait for the movie...
neen kano bevarsi.......
will watch and come back to u.....
shut up man...i've watched the machinist where the person is suffering from insomnia.that is the only thing which is matching.....every 1 knows who is posting idiotic comments...watch lucia and then come here to comment on that.dont simply post comments like a fool..
gubald i just saw 'the machinist' now.there's no such resemblence.if u find any share it.....
"watch 'fight club', if u can?"
"ley ajam, nin antha bevarsi ge ""resemblance"" gothagala bidu. first learn to spell correctly before posting your idiotic comments"
please explain where you saw the resemblance to fightclub. manasaare and one flew over the cuckoo's nest were deeply connected!!!! please explain how?(except for the mental hospital)
pawan sir........... am a big fan of u n i wanna meet u n work with u as i also have some new creative ideas n have dream to create a world premiere movie in kannada...
"this is brilliant! :) the way the whole thing has been shot.. AT_USER : you've raised the bar to a different level.. never expected to see off-beat films in ""sandalwood"" atleast! :) cheers!! and yes if you're still looking for singers, or any creative assistance, i could be of some help! :) do let me know pawan.."
love the fresh tune of this song - youtube.com/watch?v=01hi-8scisa movie looks promising... waiting besides inox without sleep :)
superb film i love kannada only 
is this movie available only online?? won't it get released in theatres??
pawan you're probably the best young directors to enter kannada industry. wish that lucia too will become a big hit like lifeu ishtene.
"simply awesome.. not watched kannada movie for last few years.. this movie will make me go to theatre..need a serious shift in kannada movie making from.. just fighting, poor boy-rich girl, mandatory villain, pathetic script, poor direction..etc. best thing that i see in lucia trailer is.. cinema photography, freshness, cast.. i am kannadiga and love to see kannada language movie to expand its reach to intelligent and tasteful audience but voluntarily ithrough mproving quality of our movies.."
probably the last few years you have missed lot of good kannad movies. its time you catch up all of them.
"by looking at this trailer & quality of the photography, i pre-ordered this movie (by paying 2,500/- rupees ). request the viewers to support this unique initiative of pawan by pre-ordering the movie."
super sir!! heavy thrill ide ansutte. psychological thrillera?
lol fight club.. i dont see any resemblance
"pawan, its a good effort but it has a lot of resemblance to 'fight club'...hope you've seen that movie.. also 'manasaare' and 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' were deeply connected.. manasare was written by u.. do write your opinion on this opinion.. clear the air.."
totally new effort and nice one
"pawan y can't approach ur guru mr.bhatt,"
am the big fan of u pavan.....i want to produce your next movie ..plz give me a chance..plz contact me on 9241040442
grt pawan.. its gonna bring new era.. by trailer its giving the hope that its gonna be mix of drug mafia with love... hope it should have a thrilling screenplay with best cinematography... looks super pawan.. all the best... :)
"audio release ge wait maadta iddini.. specially "" ,   !"" ... have watched this trailer for long enough and watched 'the machinist' and 'tfc' and read the comments below.. sumne typing practise maadtira :p looks very promising and fresh ! all the best pawan.. p.s : eagerly waiting for my copy of pre-order :p"
"a decent trailor pawan, please keep the movie nice. im a kannadiga who expect more than just remakes from kannada film industry. we are capable of more. please get new and talented kannada actors up.. i want to see a fantabulous kannada movie.. than remains in peoples mind.. mungaru male was the last such movie.. literally all i know have seen that movie (no region bar). all the best.. i will watch all kannada movie that is promising and a decent trial for awesomness. thank you"
trailer looks interesting.. eager to watch it.
hi pawan is it possible to release in theatre in glasgow(uk) . i can watch in home talkies but like watch it in cinemas. i know very few kannada people staying here. just asking. but great work pawan  waiting for this movie....
"interesting film, and,amazing camera work... loved it.."
loved it :)
benki.i.i.............
good
suparrrrrr...... 
    ....   releasu??
mr sharp.. good  you wish good for all .... i was in us too and if you idolize some one and he is called dude .. may be you can take it .. but certainly not his fans !!! definitely not me !!!!
"mr shar859 !!!!!! please keeep in mind .. pawan is our celebrity .. be fore making any unwarranted comments i suggest you not to use this forum .. he is not your ""dude""... he is doing an outstanding job and is a great person!!!! please note he has taken time to respond to you here , that it self is exclamatory ... all the best to you and your friend!!!"
in us ah ? ... well i think its been used fairly every where .. ... mr pawan kumar is much better !!!! .... i fairly understood from the comments on whats happening.... silly is too subjective mr sharp ....
"the machinist !!! go home dude !! you are drunk ... the movie is not yet released , lets wait n see. AT_USER the trailer is really great !!!!!"
"i think you started the issue here... in an attempt to get attention. this is the trailer of the film.. nothing to do with the singing competition.. so your first comment was totally unrelated and uncalled for. so my question is why bring it up here in the first place? unless you guys wanted some sympathy. and tht too after answering to ur friend personally in an email that the results will be announced at a later stage. she hasn""t made it. in bold and clear. pls convey the same. thank you."
i hope u have seen the the machinist.
"ur friend didn't make it... she had the potential but after seeing the attitude that she has.. we are not going to support or promote or even call her in the future. and pls know and tell her that we can block her video of our song on grounds of copyright violation. but we wont do that... we will let her use it as her audition piece. but if this 'sympathy calls' crosses the limits, we will pull her video out. pls convey the same."
"even i hve heard few responses, maybe the original song was better than the responses!!"
a guy who makes a nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who has ever built a chair. jesse eisenberg ...social network! just cos he suffers from insomnia doesn't mean its a rip off from machinist! resemblance is one thing ! rip off is another !
are u really from karnataka..???..........go get a life.....commenting twice wont affect the movie......
"good trailer, though i wouldnt have included the eating by hand scene +/- washing scene as its slightly revolting."
"hai pawan,great effort...any way even i want to promote your movie without any expectation.i hve some new ideas ,if u don't mind u can contact me ....good luck !"
please make this movie an inspiration to other film industry. trailer has nice art and visualization. awesome pavan. 
superb trailer!
i was awaiting for the first look of this movie ever since it was announced...and it looks amazing!!! hats off to the team!! all the best!!

"very nice dear, nimma shrama saartakavaagali. "
superb trailer pavan all the best :)
all the very best bro. proud to be a part of a kannada audience to watch a breakthrough after long trails of stereotypical kannada cinema.
thank god...finally the movie trailer is out...we have lot of hopes on this move and we are sure that we will not be disappointed.
"for all those who think it is a remake of fight club..please do watch fight club again.first,the protagonist in fight club is not intoxicated,secondly insomnia is an universal disease and not necessary that it has to be driven from fight club.thirdly,edward norton has a tough time accepting himself so he creates an alter ego in the form of tyler durden who is nowhere like the punk guy in lucia.context of this movie is totally different and it is very unique.all d best pawan!really impressed!"
thanks for giving dis trailer
"yes, the few taxi driver, fight club influences are visible but what the heck. this looks really promising and fresh. love the crowd funding concept. waiting for its release."
i love d trailer & dt sng .......
pawan sir.......love u...... after life istene one more rocking movie. waiting for release. please release it in hyderabad.
did a pre-order..
"be it inspired from fight club, be it limitless, be it machinist.. every movie is inspired from something. . and pawan is such a director that he has his own unique style of movie making.. i don't think he would copy something. . but sure he will give it a new definition. . anyway the concept is new to kannada. . i'll definitely watch it :) colorfull trailer :) all the best pawan at 1:52 the guy asks ""who's this girl?"" and that voice is directors'..!!"
"AT_USER ur comments would have made some sense, if you had commented after watching the full movie....and then, coming to ur point, there are zillions of movies in hollywood which deals with insomnia concept... for example the classic de niro's taxi driver, nolan's ""insomnia"",  as you mentioned fight club and the recent one ""the girl with dragon tatoo"" and all stories are different from each other... so, plz before shitting something in the internet, think twice..."
gud work ! waitin :)
thanks for the trailer....... waiting to see the movie... thanks for upload......
"no, looks like you haven't watched fight club (1999). machinist was inspired by fight club but this one above lucia appears like a fight club remake. valid points are as follows. the film clearly deals with insomnia like fight club. gaurish akki asks, is your girlfriend an imagination of yours, which is another plot twist from fight club. the tattooed punk in lucia trailer is like brad pitt's tyler durden. there is a projector in fight club just like the one above (may not be a valid point)."
2 people who disliked didnt sleep for nights.. :-p
good cinematography. but looks like your movie is inspired by david fincher's fight club.
superrrrrrrrrrrrrr
superagede ............traileruuuu
the heroine is cute... i will surely watch
looks a lot like limitless
"super trailer boss, waiting to watch the full movie.............. "
waiting to watch either at talkies or @ home talkies :-) best of luck.
super!!! waiting to watch!
"woh.. interest huttisbittte guru... eega movie nodade, nemmadi iraala.."
"this movie is free of stars and market pressures, which primarily controlling the content of the movies that we are watching today. the success of this project could create a parallel industry for kannada films making it fair and effective. any one with talent will be able to pursue a successful career in the film industry without having to worry about 'background'.          !!!"
awsome... simply superb
looks very creative...waiting forward for this movie!!!! and its pawan's ....!!! so it has to be good ...
maaama.. ashten kick illvalla trailer alli!!!??
great to know that u got to know the twist from this trailer itself.. god bless you!
"super trailer rocks, will pre order the movie today :) awesome"

hi sirr!! the trailer is really good...hope the movie is too...reminded me of bradley cooper's 'limitless'...hope its original...all the best :)
expectations did't went wrong.. hope it will be the blockbuster of 2013 :)

wow 
i had so much expectations on lucia turned out to be simple kinda movie with little twist i watched many times to get feel of it but dont know there is little lag and not that great for sure to be very frank its doesnt create kick ass interest but above on par with other kannada movies for sure. will wait for movie. please note a very true and frank opinion from my side.
