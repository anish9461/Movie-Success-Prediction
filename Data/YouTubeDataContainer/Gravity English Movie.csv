i already found this full movie on this site: moviesstreamer.weebly.com
totally agreed a must see in 3d make the movie even more intense. happy i saw it in 3d.
"if anyone wants to see the full movie hd, u will find it in good quality at ."
"he's entitled to his own opinion... i agree with you there have been amazing fils out in the last year, but he can feel the way he want, uk? i'm not trying to take sides so please don't take this the wrong way. i probably shouldn't even but in but i just feel like this is unnecessary drama. sorry if this upsets you, i just thought i'd say it!"
noooo like first 30;)
it was literally amazing
saw it in imax amaaaazzzing!!
dun dun chhh
so was sandra bullock....
"totally dude, i agree with you. you have to be touching the globe in order for gps to remotely work, wtf were the scriptwriters thinking. this is what happens when movies get hollywood standards."
i just saw this movie today. blown away.
"where are you?"" ""i don't know, gps is down.."" are they in space (out of the globe)? who wrote the script..."
spoiler alert george clooney dies in like the first 5 minutes
well fuck you up the ass hole motherfucker. see me in real life i'll crack your fuckin skull. talking like that to people you dont knew is going to get your ass bruised and battered bitch.
"please, sandra bullock don't die t.t"
nah... kerbal space program. :d
the moon 
"what if they made a prequel to this movie called, ""buoyancy"""
"spaces drift eh? he could have been saved as there were no forces acting on them at that point in time. learn some basic physics before you start to say dumb things like that. there are some fundamental flaws in the reality of the movie, but it was still a good thriller."
"all i got is the trailer, not the full movie :("
"there hasn't been a great space survival film since apollo 13. after armageddon and apollo 18, it seemed that there would never be another good film taking place outside of earth, but gravity was the answer to solve this problem. this film is one of the best films in recent years and should easily win multiple awards."
sexist.
screw you.
no one should watch this movie. without buying tickets for 3d glasses!
"it was impossible for him to save himself do to the fact space's drift was pulling him away. the space stuff is from a sattelite that russians destroyed. ever heard of space debris? they had to find it since the only escape pod left in i.s.s was destroyed do to a parachute malfunction. so sandra makes it back to earth, after losing everything, and gains faith in god while doing so. that's it, eh?"
this is the most powerful movie i have seen since life of pi. forget your opinion!
go watch pirates of the carribean. fits your description perfectly.
"and i am just telling you my opinion okay, your opinion and general taste in movies must be utter shit. and you sound like a troll, as bad as the one from the fellowship of the rings, with the bugger hanging... idk its just my opinion..."
space kerbal program anyone ?
you don't know shit. there have been plenty of decent films in the last year. you only notice the shit because the it's all your brain seems to notice.
bebe mangzu must have a platinum vagina 
saw this movie......and i never go to the movies. 99% of the movies out recently have been crap. this movie is that 1%. that actually contains substance and not a bunch of flashy stylized hollow crap......great film!
"if you have money than go to cinema and watch it in hd, it really worth money, perfect movie one of better movie this year! but if you don't have money i could suggest you this website where i usually watch new movies on the internet. all films are hq (not cam). you can try out, it might help you: m o v i e s2013.c o (just remove spaces) bump my comment if i helped you so others can watch it too :) best wishes to everyone"
how come? it gets a 9.1/10 rating from rottentomatoes critics and 4.3/5 from the fans? must be a good movie?
couldn't they try to use the shuttle to dock with the iss which is featured so they could obviously not have to do orbital plane adaptations
i already found this full movie on this site: moviesstreamer.weebly.com
"all this movie is about is sandra and george, lost in space. they were fixing something in space, they get attacked from space stuff, and then they have to find the russian and chinese spaceship. george volunteers to die, which was unneccesary, cause he could of survived too. so sandra makes it back to earth, only after encountering so many troubles. that's it. i didn't think it was a good movie at all."
"if anyone wants to see the full movie in hd not cam, go to . enjoy ."
okay... i tend to get nauseous a lot at 3d a lot even at normal calm movies so this seemed very over the top for me.
good for you.
everybody in the enitre world!!!!!don't watch this movie!!!!!!! without watching it in imax 3d
"yes there is air in their head space but if there's no air around the outside of the suit, they cannot hear a sound. unless being in contact with the object itself. even if there is an explosion, if they are well outside the blast radius. they won't hear it. i understand that it's a movie, made by hollywood, and does not need to obey all if any laws of physics. everything you wrote kinda just expanded from what i wrote, ""it's a movie!"
i went in to watch this with optimism. it was really shit to be honest. sandra bullock was a bad choice and george's role was average at best. the cinematography was fantastic but the story and dialog was average. 3/10 for me
"this movie was so bad, don't watch it and save your money."
watch box office new movies from your home rather than paid money in theatre . watch lastest movies free at : watchusamovies . net enjoy it !
damn it russia.......
"the point is the movie is shot from the point of view of the characters, what they hear, you have to hear as well. if an astronaut is in a space suit which is attached to large objects like in these scenes and there are huge crashes, the vibrations should go through the solids into the head space of the suit where there is air and thus thumping sounds could be experienced by the character, and in extension - by us."
i'd be so much more excited about this film if sandra bullock wasn't playing the main role
easily the best movie this year!
where is 2k????
"if anyone wants to see the full movie in hd not cam, go to . enjoy ."
"if you have money than go to cinema and watch it in hd, it really worth, really good movie one of better movie lately! but if you don't have money i can suggest you this site where i commonly watch new movies online. all movies are in hd (not cam) with pretty quality of sound too. you might check out, it might help you: m o v i e s2013.c o thumbs up my comment if i helped you so other could watch it too ;) enjoy to all ;)"

"if anyone didnt like this movie or felt like they were not in outerspace,they r in the wrong theatre in d wrong seat or they must have seen it in 2d..i found out that 2day..first time when i went to c it,gravity was an 'xperience', today i went to another theatre to c it, even though in 3d,it was like cing anthr 3d movie:-(. pls c dis masterpiece in the max effct theatr u can find..:-)"
that's what happen when women go out of the kitchen !
"sound is just vibrations traveling through air. in empty space, there is no air. so objects crashing into each other will not cause any vibrations. however, if there is presence of gas, then it is possible since gasses can propogate sound waves. but if the gas cloud is not dense enough, it won't be able to create large enough waves that can travel any significant distance or impacts on our eardrums. a good sound recorder could i suppose. i think hollywood has a couple of them. lol, it's a movie!"
english... 
"i know, but the camera viewpoint is suspended in space, not attached to a solid surface connected to the source of the impact/explosions! i know, i'm being a party pooper and all, but the only times you should hear these sounds are when the camera is attached to a solid surface (as you mentioned) or from inside a spacecraft where the impact is conducted through the hull and air molecules inside the pressurized cabin ;p"
yeah the ... 3d ...the technology of the 80s but.. its now! ... dude seriously...
"sooo anoying her moaning, put her in a porn."

that creeps me out every time
it's either we gonna see her floating in space for almost 2 hours seeing her life passing through her eyes or either aliens.. im gonna guess its option number 1 since it a movie with sandra bullock and george clooney so the chances are slim that those 2 will be in a movie with aliens ..
we want godzilla
don't do drugs
i had the same thought as you.. until i watched 3d imax... it was very impressive... you may want to consider.
"i'm just telling you guys my opinion okay, this was one of the worst movies ive ever seen, it was as bad as little ms sunshine.. idk its just my opinion.."
watch it full at  flicks.me\gravity-2013 enjoy it
the subtitles of this movie ah ah ah aha ha aaah aha ah aha aha aha aha ah aha ah ah ah ah ah ha ha ha ah aha ah ah
right? i used to want to be an astronaut until i saw apollo 13... this movie did not help lessen my fear of space... lol
oh sandra bullock win the oscar please. :)
"i saw the full movie in hd at . yesterday, it was a really good movie :d"
r.i.p. every wannabe astronaut
i would watch it if sandra bullock didn't have the most annoying voice i've ever heard a human being have.
"well i liked it. they did a good job showing the disorientation that can happen up there, in a very hostile environment. the soundtrack annoyed me a few times, abruptly going from loud to silent. also... it's odd how the other astronaut knows nothing about dr stone's personal life - had no idea where she came from or whether she was single, etc. i loved the final scene where escapes the capsule and stands up -- she's overcome all the odds."
always haters its incredible
"in rod we trust, lol"
check out my cover trailer if you want
easily one of the best movies i've ever seen in my life.
simpsons did it.
russians did it before
i saw the movie! it friggin' blew me away!
"astrophobia- fear of stars or celestial space."" i think i have this."
i already found this full movie on this site: moviesstreamer.weebly.com
your surprised? maybe because your critique is wrong and your a cunt so sit down..
lol
i saw this movie i love it!!!
"i'm not saying this is a bad movie, but it sure doesn't deserve that huge vibe.. sandra bullock is a bad actress and many facts aren't scientifically logic in the movie. anyway, i'm surprised to see almost no bad reviews.."
oh man i wanna see it :(
wtf wtf
between heaven and earth .... it may happen .....?
"if you did, you'd be dead within the hour. hence why the likes of us remain down here on terra firma."
"this is too much like tomb raider 2013, the sound is the same."
that's too bad for you then cause in 3d it's awesome! 2d my ass
"AT_USER adams, link doesn't work unless you sign up for something!!"
i think i would be freaking out just a little bit more than what she's like at the beginning
i already found this full movie on this site: moviesstreamer.weebly.com
looks like a specsavers advert
"yes, you could, you couldn't reproduce or anything, but a young human could live there his entire life, it would just be difficult, time consuming and costly"
"if you have money than go to cinema and watch it in , it really worth money, perfect movie one of better film this year! but if you don't have money i can suggest you this site where i commonly watch new movies on the internet. all films are hq (not cam, 720p is). you could try out, it might help you: m o v i eleaks. c o (just remove spaces between) bump up my comment if it helped you so others can watch it too :) best wishes everyone"
"sure, we could live on planets, though we would become partially blind and weak in our limbs. however, planets are within an atmosphere. the space they refer to has no atmosphere, the black nothingness. you can't live drifting through space forever."
hi all just go to flicks.me\gravity-2013 enjoy
i saw it at the movies and i hated it i wish if they would return my money back .just my opinion don't hate
there's so much god damn spam here
"j'ai du got, nuance l'cervel.. toi par contre, tu doit avoir une fosse septique a la place de la bouche... ta chane va tre soumis  un avertissement pour violence verbale, voir une demande de fermeture..une plainte vient d'tre dpos auprs du service modrateur.. bonne soire....."
looks a bit shit
"when they wrote ""life in space is impossible"" i don't think they meant like on a planet, i think they meant that life is impossible in space as in the black shit outside the planets. i hope that made sense..cuz i'm not sure it did.."
"i saw the full movie hd at .. yesterday, it was a really good movie :d"
un film vraiment bluffant ! extraordinaire !!
"no it isn't, nasa has even confirmed that humans could live in space"
"in case you have money than go to cinema and watch it in hd, it really worth money, perfect movie maybe the best movie lately! but if you don't have money i can suggest you this website where i commonly watch new movies online. all films are hd (not cam, it's 720p), with good quality of sound and video. you could try with it, it might help you: movie leaks. c o bump my comment if it helped you so other could watch it too :) best wishes to everyone"
this movie really looks stupid
"i really did not like seeing this movie in 3d. the distance apart from the left and right images of objects were off. for example, if someone was supposedly floating 50 or 100 yards in the background, they were smaller (and they should be) but they still obviously had the 3d perspective of something very close. even the mountains on earth, which should be hundreds of miles away, clearly had 3d perspective. they should not pop out."
"but earth is in place, so life is possible..."
yeah but for humans it is.
"AT_USER tidd, thanks, it's such good quality!!!"
aaaaaahh. **the more you know!**
great movie.....
life in space is not impossible?
"i respect the bullock and clooney but this looks like dead dog piece of shit movie, no good cocksucker effects and fack the hulk hogan."
superb movie
"can you tell me the name of that story please,i would like to read it"
"there is nothing to carry sound in pure space like air. if you have contact to something which is being hit, sound is carried through the object to you."
"if u want to watch it, just go to flicks.me\gravity-2013 enjoy and have nice day"
"saw this movie in 3d yesterday. one of the best films i've seen in quite awhile. the only thing was that it made me so tense, my back was hurting after."
"they added those crashing sounds in the trailer to make it more appealing, in the movie itself you won't hear them ;)"
"@ 372 miles above the earth, there is nothing to carry sound..."" followed by a sound of impact and other crashing sounds. k?"
"you think this shouldn't be shown in 2d? i got dizzy from watching the fricking trailer, if i watch this in 3d i'm throwing up all over the cinema. incredible viewing experience my ass."
see gravity 2013 hd at bit.ly\watchmov?v=3124 
"i did, although i always try to avoid watching them in their 3d version. its overpriced and disturbs too much"
"check out the videos on my channel, let me know what you think"
"as amazing as the film is, all it's trailers are terrible. no, it is not 90 minutes of sandra bullock screaming and spinning in space: in the 90-minute film, there's maybe 10 minutes of genuinely terrifying footage in that respect. no, don't believe the trailers: this is not some brain dead micheal bay flick, rather, a beautiful and epic space adventure that makes for one of the best movies in years, period."
fuck why sandra bullock? they should totally use some other hot chick like alice eve or smth. i am bored of bullock...
"looks crap, all sandra bullock is doing is screaming it sounds like i'm watching porn"
you obviously didn't watch this movie in 3d
"i don't wanna spoil you if you haven't seen the movie yet, but, one actor is more appropriate to describe the main part of this movie."
this film is in cinemas on the 7th of november... why does it have to be so late?!?!?!
looks fucking awesome :)
3d is ugly. you must be out of your mind if you think that 3d is a better visual experience than 2d
absolutely breathtaking in 3d. must see it.
"after a few months of seeing not much, these new trailers reveal it to hopefully be a very intense and full-on sf movie. it seems to take what this director has done in the past and put it into a space location very well."
"i would like to suggest you that if you have money than go to cinema and watch it, it really worth paid money. i think this is one of the best movies this year. but if you don't have money i would suggest you this site where i usually watch new movies. i like it because all movies are in hd (not cam like many others). here is link to it: m o v i e s 2013.c o (just remove spaces) i hope that i helped you. if i do, thumbs up my comment so we can help other people to to watch it :) enjoy everybody"
"the explosion causing the banging and smashing is all from objects either attached to characters with microphones in their suits, or parts of the iss with wall mounted comms. even in space, sound travels through solids."
"lol 0:07 ""at 372 miles above the earth, there is nothing to carry sound"" four seconds later begin the loud explosions and michael bay-esque screaming! ok, the screaming may be via their microphones... but still, no excuse for all the banging and smashing sounds lol"
"i loved it ! don't expect a fantastic scenario, but the film is amazing."
it's still in the movies! there is no possible way for it to be on the internet in hd!!!
"george clooney is like: ""i'm the expensive actor so i have to day at the beginning."" :d"
but that backflip at 0:58 tho
does anyone have link to watch gravity online for free in hd? thanks
buuulllshit 
"incredible visual experience. it's a huge difference when seeing it in 3d, i don't think this should ever be shown in theaters in 2d. the direction, music, sense of loneliness portrayed by a very believable performance of sandra bullok make this one of the best movies in the last years."
except she only received 6 months of training compared to most astronauts' years of training. she was only up there to fix the hubble.
i was watching this at night in my bedroom. my mum thought i was watching porn -_-
this movie was not boring as hell.
gravity full movie hd on my channel . .
lol not close.
this movie was boring as hell.
check out my cover trailer if you want
starring sandra bullock george clooney and no one else
boring
its gonna be a shit film
"you will drift forever due to inertia in space as you know...and since the average distance between stars in space is about 4,150 light years....you will probably never contact anything but just move away in open space"
"it was hopeful... for the truest truths are what hold us together, or keep us painfully, desperately apart"
wasn;t as good as that movie...that movie was probably one of the most important movies ever made
this is the stolen story
my parents thought i was watching porn -.- 0.o
"this better be good,,,,,im hearing its on a par with 2001 space oddeysey,,fingers crossed"
"this movie was great, but it was really depressing"
watch full movie here -> moviesstreamer.weebly.com
"the basis of this was a ray bradbury story when a space ship split and all the occupants who hated each other were thrown out into the black and started shouting insults at one and all. until...best worth reading. if most movie critics had known this they'd have known this film was a rip off. the deep meanings of stuff and more importantly, your own behaviour while existing was addressed in about 8 pages"
are u also masturbating while sandra is moaning? :d
this looks crap ( but better than an adam sandler film)
1: lets see you not panic spinning wildly away from earth 2: would you prefer actually toss people around in space? 3: fuck you
here's a challenge for you drift uncontrolably away from earth and try not to panic
exactly everyone who's commenting about her moaning ruins the film when it's part of the film it doesn't matter how prepared astronauts are they r still going to panic when they keep drifting away from earth with nothing but the darkness and nothingness of space around them
too much spinning around for my taste. i feel dizzy after seen this trailer.
1: too much yelling 2: is this a 3d animated movie 3: fuck this movie!
what are you going to do when suddenly you start flying away from all civilization in circles into the unknown without a shred of hope?
"her screaming is annoying , i think i can't finish the whole movie with this ."
this is it? this is the whole movie?
"mmm, yes exactly!"
"it was an obvious plot, it would been better if she had die at the end to make it more emotional!"
"who said this movie was soooo great? i don't get it! when i got out from the cinema after watching the movie the only thing i had in my mind about it was ""so, was that it???"". i think the effects where cool and such but the story was horrible and nothing happened expect from what you see in the trailer! not a terrible movie but since i had such high hopes about it, it made me angry that it did not anywhere nearby live up to my expectations......"
if she had detached when facing earth she would have flown towards earth and slowly burned as she entered the atmosphere xd
imax is shit anyway.
i have to see full movie.
the best movie i've ever seen.
absolutely amazing.
it's no longer playing in imax. can't fucking believe i missed it! >:(
i haven't seen the movie yet. i'm very interested even though this trailer is one of the worsts i've ever seen!
gravity..it changes everything.
an asshole sorry for my bad grammar lol
no the movie is pretty good but you don't have to be a asshole...
i got a heart attack...
this sounds like a fucking porno...
"a bit unbelievable but an awesome escape from our everyday, boring lives .effects are quite good."
perfect movie!!!!
you people just dont understand the gravity of her situation
"i would like to suggest you that if you have money then go to the cinema and watch it, really worth money. but if you don't have much money you can try with this site where i usually watch new movies online in decent quality (720p) and also sound is pretty good. here is link to it: m o v i e s 2013.c o i hope you will like it. also, if you do, please thumbs up my comment so other people can see and watch this awesome movie for free :) best wishes"

gravity can't forget to pull me back to the ground again said beyonce..
"un chef d'oeuvre...hallucinant de ralisme...la 3d donne vraiment l'impression d'tre avec eux...je suis trop content de ne pas l'avoir rat au cin...j'le conseille.. pour moi, le meilleur rle de sandra bullock, elle mrite carrment l'oscar..!!! vivement le bluray..!!"

hallucinant. je n'est pas l'impression d'tre all au cinma mais d'avoir vcu une exprience (comme la diffrence entre une toile de czanne et une performance contemporaine). une exprience diffrente qui n'est plus pareille. je ne pourrais plus voir les films en relief ou  effets spciaux de la mme manire aprs celui l. c'est l'adquation parfaite entre l'image visuelle ingal et l'histoire simple et poignante qui rends le film aussi immersif.
guys watch the movie in the cinema-trust me it's an unforgettable experience-especially in 3d
"i just watched this movie- its fucking amazing. without a doubt it's the best film in the year, the acting was excellent, the directing worthy of an oscar, and so packed with tension i was getting leg craps in the movie theatre. an incredible movie-it willdominate the academy awards."
my team at my middle schools gonna watch this it looks pretty good
"she survives at the end, uses the thrust launch of the shuttle pod and ends up in the water and at the end they show her walking away, naf movie. don't waste your time, wait for it on dvd and then watch it."
totally agree. gravity is a profound experience and a milestone in cinema.
"guys, for once, let's not use websites like this, the quality will downgrade the movies to an astounding amount."
every actor is absolutely flawless.i watched the full movie at .. .
gravity hd full movie at .. ..

lovely movie!!! saw in 3d !! woooo
fight gravity fuck this movie
"movie is great if u cant go to sleep, will put u to sleep, better than a sleeping pill"
"the most terrifying, exhilarating, profound films in space. love space movies, this & 2001 are my favorites. not metaphysical, but a powerful journey of a lost & depressed character, has nothing/no one on earth for her, no will to live, not even an astronaut, but an engineer, gets her training for this one experiment she's performing, hates space, is thrust into a horrifying situation & forces her will to live to come out. the ending triumphant her performance is powerful. technically astounding"

gravity 2013 hd full movie at .. . 
very bad
it's better you watch waar movie makes more sense than this shitt
all i can say is lots of rubbish damn it.
no it isnt
when i first saw this trailer i thought it was a comedy. when i spotted sandra bullocks face in the helmet i really thought it was a comedy. if this film was a comedy i'd probably go watch it. i can't take sandra bullock in a spacesuit seriously.
"you have to see it in 3d in a theater, trust me it is so worth it."
but astronauts are usually equipped with tiny little thrusters in the event that they get disconnected.
"wow... the whole trailer was her grunting, and it was bad acting as well if you ask me!"
i want to see this!!!
"i do not see why this film critic compares to that of kubrick, ah! yes space. in any case, congratulations to sandra bullock and clooney for their presence because the dialogue is deeper than the black hole. congratulations to cameron and his team for their effects.'s what the 3 d brings something, blah, digital image quality would have been enough, but sorry, it is fashionable."

woohoo!
"i try to get from your ""..' but i got adverdisement only...could you advise me the correct way ...i want see this movie...thank you"
can you fucking imagine? what would you do?
"actually i watched it today, pretty dozed off in the movie!!"
exactly what i was thinking hahahaha
gravity is the most memorable survival movie i've seen. i've watched in hd quality at .. .
how
i agree
"hey is it actually worth going to watch? to me it looks really boring, seems like nothing can really happen in space for 90 minutes."
"ta blood klart rass that looks sick!!!! i love that space shit, that woman's pretty much finished!"
"when james cameron says he was ""stunned, absolutely floored"" by a movie, it's so good it should be illegal not to watch it"
muy buena peli de sandra bullock
argghg aarghghgar argghghg arghgh
even arnold schwarzenegger had a better dialogue
this movie was good.
