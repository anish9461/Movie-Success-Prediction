this is the song :d donovan - hurdy gurdy man 720p hd
i will not turn behind!!
"i never get scared watching hollywood scary movies! but the conjuring, that's a different story! i literally shit my pants while watching this movie. highly recommended!"
i just saw it it was disturbing. really epic! if you watch it you'll confute wat is the real story in this movie? i just don't got it-but i luv it.
can someone please tell me is this movie about a doll i read in a comment that this movie is about a evil doll. based on the true story of annabelle the haunting doll is it true please reply thank you!:)
"this one and the insidious movies are so freaking scary, and i say that as a guy that normaly dont get scared of jump scares!"
is it real ???
saw the movie. it was sooo scary. you should really watch this one if you want to see a good horror movie
check out my scary movie teaser on my channel! thanks
"great movie it kept me scared. very interesting story, and very fucked up. one of the best horrorflicks since sinister and infamous.this movie deserves the reviews it gets i give it a 9/10"
the trailer only made me scared as shit ! no way wont download thaat movie ever ! ( im +18 )
"i loved this movie, bring on part 2 if there is one :d"
what is the song at 0:28 ?
"this is fucking awesome.,,,the best ever"
i just watched this movie. definitely one of the best horror flicks in a long time. it was actually pretty scary.
"what a let down! body count: 0. happy ending??? no, this commercial brought to you by the vatican did not scare me back into the congregation. nice try."
"this movie did something that most of todays horror movies lack--good scary scenes and a lot of them from the beginning. too many horror movies try to incorporate an intelligent theme that usually drags the movie to nowhere--this one just kept the story simple and hair raising. if i were to categorize it, it would be a combination of poltergeist with the exorcist and very entertaining."
"this was a very atmospheric and suspenseful horror. shades of amityville and the exorcist. it does on occasion draw upon the usual gimmicks that you might expect, but there's more than enough originality to make it seem pretty fresh. i was pleasantly surprised. very good movie."
watched the conjuering last night!!!! best movie ever
"one of the best movies i have known. will buy the dvd, which i usually don't do for a horror movie. i was crying at the end of it - the suffering both families endure was too much."
holy shit
i watched today from my new 130 inch projector thus movie and after that rec. holy shit this movie is peace of shit compared rec. so fucking boring too
"supernatural horror movies are always same, it's always some hunted house and there is some demon or ghost that is angry because of something in the past. what happened to real horror films? these films are all the same, they just have better computer effects, plot is mostly same and scenes are like everyhing is firstly quiet and dark but then some monstrosity appears from nowhere with some ''creepy'' face. that's not horror that bs!"
never ever. fuck this
im used to these movies
saw this a couple of days before halloween and it may be the scariest movie i have ever scene. and if not this than evil dead.
aaaahhhhh! i seen the movie i am so happy that i wasnt alone
omg!!! it has creeped me out!!!! i am definitely going to watch it
there is going to be a spin-off about the doll annabelle!
lmao
not scary but i like the story
it is way better than insidious 2.i had nightmares.
the movie is ok but is full of christian propaganda.
watch this movie online for free in hd quality on youmooviz. com
"anyone knows if this movie starts with 2 girls talking about a doll? i downloaded and i started watching then the doll apeared and i changed my mind(i mean if im gonna pee my pants in the first 5 seconds of the movie i ll die after 30 minutes), but i might have downloaded the wrong thing?"

"gotta watch this sometime, skipped it thinking it was all just hype and jump scares, but now i think it's time to fix that :3"
"i really like how the stars in this truly fit the characters, you already know? if you haven't viewed the whole movie yet, you probably do not know what i am talking about. why wait to watch it at the theater when you can check it out for free over the internet at this streaming movie website i came across. go to this web-site and discover watchthesemovies.com"
"one good horror movie for the past months, if not years, thank you"
watch it at a cinema alone
i really enjoyed with this movie. one of the best horror movies which i've ever seen !
i was watching this movie and half way through it rewinded itself and started all over again.
the clapping hands. need i say more.
don't look down look up to be a man
"i did not find the movie very scary or very good at all,for that matter. kept waiting for something;finally gave up,turned it off."
this movie scared me
haha. yeah man. i would enjoy seeing a ghost and stuff fly off shelves just don't touch me and don't hit me with anything.
"best horror film of 2013, hands down"
"enjoy the trailer? hope you are able to watch the movie? i discovered a spot over the internet that enables you to quickly and securely watch heaps of different hit movies - even this one that is not out yet. their collection is beyond this world. they have got something for the whole family - even my brother! haha . . . seriously, right here is the website url... watchthesemovies.com"

"this movie reminds me of ""the haunted"" from 1991 for some reason. the haunted was quite creepy and scary back in the day."
this isn't the sole trailer that made me enjoy seeing a movie so i searched everywhere on the net for someplace to see movies safely without spending a dime. i at last found one and so i thought i'd share with you guys so you can save some time! here is the website you need to go and visit for free movies. watchthesemovies.com

yeah just paranormal shit man. wow i would never use one of those. screw that.

ummmmmmmm naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
yeah i just saw the movie....who the fuck needs to sleep tonight..hmmmm not me...!!
"i wish a soul of people could actually do that, it would be a solution, a way to make the bad people pay for what they have done to you when the people who got paid to do their duties refused to do their duties."
watch out we got a badass here!!
i shit my pants
"i thought this movie was awesome, for one main reason alone and that was the director didn't throw a load of pointless hyped drama into it like you get with most generic horror movies where the people fight amongst themselves, great movie i'd highly recommend"
"i saw it alone at midnight, hoping to be piss scared. and....nothing. this movies blew"
this is the scariest movie i ever saw. almost cried :d
watt
"i just watched it, the movie is awesome, only thing i didn't like about it is the end, happy end in a movie like this just isn't the way to go..(but they had to do it that way because it is based on a true story, so i guess it's okay) 8/10 and i recommend it to anyone that isn't scared to watch it! :)"
i find scary movie not really good with a low budget but they make plenty million why?
this film look's fucking hilarious haha xd
i hate this move it scared the shit out of me i watched 8 times already i am watching it right now this is wort than any movie i have ever seen.
i just got back from this movie... now i must go to a hospital to exam my poor little heart...
if you have seen it alone then i am sure you are not able to laugh..... it is fuking scary....... :)
i lohe this movie. its so scary
whoever says this movie isn't scary really have fuckin issues and better go for check up! this was the scariest movie i've ever watched. it's been 3 days and i'm still paranoid!
this was a great movie! but im kinda disappointed that it wasn't scary to me. none of these movies coming out now are scary
i watched it last night and it was scary and funny idk why
watched it it was weird
literally the funniest movie ever. i watched it yesterday with my friends and i couldn't stop laughing and they all got mad at me ahahahah. i just thought it was really funny hahahaha
"this trailer is awesome, however the entire movie is much better. if you do not believe me, you must watch it yourself. i know of this amazing web site where you could securely stream movies such as this one and a lot more. they have tons of different hit movies. here's the web site link to check it out. watchthesemovies.com"
one of the most boring horror movies ever made..
"i feel you, horror movies are not what they used to be.. i mean, what's scary about a slamming door or 'nothing' pulling on a girls hair?"
"saw it yesterday, scariest film of the 2000century yet;)"
my favorite horror movie (:
"i dont get scared with movies like this, but i would say this was pretty scary. i dont get why it was rated r though"
 .. donovan - hurdy gurdy man
donovan - hurdy gurdy man
when i feel scared i start singing an ac/dc song and after i'm ok
what's song's name at 0:28 ?
"this trailer rocks, but the entire movie is more awesome. if you do not believe me, you need to watch it yourself. i know of this amazing site where you could safely view movies such as this one and a lot more. they got all sorts of hit movies. this is actually the site link to discover for yourself. watchthesemovies.com"
i mean it is pretty scary but it isn't like overloaded with jumpscares. it's just really freaky as hell
idk. i like psychological horror like the shining. i actually thought insidious was a lot scarier than this also
"if this isn't scary, what is?"
"to me, this movie is the scariest one....and it's amazing"
best movie ever loved it as hell never seen a movie like this in years
happy halloween everyone !!
i am alone and watching it in the dark with headphones on i am kinda scared
scariest movie i've ever seen
"worst ""movie"" ever"
i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't i can't
what's the song the background ??? AT_USER
this wasn't really scary or a scary as they made it look. humph. child's play was scarier alone in my opinion. this would be scary to watch alone in the dark...
aaaaa
"it's 3:08am now, i just finished watching this."
lol that's how i felt when i watched the possession :-]
anyone else find it questionable that this guy isnt some auto replying robot ?
                 2013
"this is the scariest movie ive ever seen, i used to love everything paranormal and i reaally wanted to try a ouija board and contact ghosts and spirits, i just watched this movie and i want nothing to do with anything paranormal...this is the scariest movie ever and to no that its a true story that just freaks the hell of me out that this actually happened im not going to sleep tonight at all"
"despite it being a true story, it's not the best horror movie i've seen, but i still enjoyed it."
good actualy very good........nd happy halloween to everyone..........!!!
watch the conjuring.... now!!!
the fact that this a true story makes it even more scarier than the movie.
removed other comment for possible slight spoilers lol. either way all three made okay watches but i still think all three lacked anything scary. the biggest problem for me is they show the monsters way too much. when they are out in the open they look over designed and cheap(insidious was just hilarious at the end.)
"creates goosebumps even when u watch it the 3rd time, so far the best horror movie"
one of the best scary movies
"no, is not that scary. now, i loved the movie yet i think insidious was better(scary). what this movie has is powerful performances by lili taylor & vera farmiga."
it was a good one. although not that frightning for some reason (or i just happen to have seen all tricks they do in such a movies and the fact i don't live in america lol)
just watched on halloween at 2 am in the morning...in my bed o.o never again
"this is probably ome of the scariest movies that i have ever seen, and i dont get scared easily. i had to stop halfway through and take a break.."
its a good movie but i did crap blocks for how scary it was
"she calls her sisters name in a stirred up voice and tells her that there is someone standing behind the door. her sister says no there is nobody their, so she walks up to the door to prove it to her. she finds nothing and says see there is nothing here, and the girl says ""it's standing right behind you"". then the door slams shut so hard and both girls are in complete shock and screaming at the top of there lungs! / that scene gives me chills, the girl in the bed (forget her name) is a phenome"
no joke people. after trick or treating... i came home and found my mom and friends watching this movie. now it's one of my favoriting movies.
"i love the scene when the little girl is in bed and her leg is getting tugged on (she thinks her sister is doing it) then still half asleep she gets a violent tug that wakes her up immediately and she discovers that her sister is asleep, so in a panic state she remains still and looks under the bed, she sees that her bedroom door is opening on it's own. she lifts her head slowly back up from underneath the bed and sees someone standing behind the door."
"it was really good, i was surprised ;f"
it's okay i didnt' mean to sleep today anyway..
good!
holly crap! this looks really scared and really goo!
it's the best horror movie i've ever seen!
funny:-)
hell no
am i the only one that thinks this movie isnt scary ?
i shat my pants. multiple times. scary
best horror i ve seen this year!!! scarry as hell !
"it's ok scary, i am 12 and have seen this and sinister their both ok. i think this is a little scarier, and it based on a true story, but in sinister there is not a happy ending! i think both are good, sinister someone murder the whole family and in conjuring no one dies, like from the new family."
its not that scary don't worry
just got done watching this movie...alone....and in the dark. pretty freaky.
fuck no
"this trailer was good, but i saw the full movie and it's better than the movie trailer suggests. don't believe i have already watched the movie? well, i found this awesome web-site that allows you to watch all kinds of hit movies at no direct cost, even this particular one which isn't released yet. the web site is below to see for yourself! watchthesemovies.com"
"awesome movies, love it!!"
watch now for free at: va4movie.com
"if you own it watch it, great night for it"
"just as good if not better than ""the exorcist"". creeped me the f out. didn't help my house started moving and i created a oujia board."
"damn, i wanna see it happy halloween y'all"
"the one thing i learned from this movie is when buying a house, make sure my dog approves of it first."
watch it now: va4movie.com
"you dont understand because you are a retard, just as the guys that believe in this faggot ass penis skippiyp okilly-dokilly hey-diddly-ho!"
this movie was leaked at: va4movie.com
it's a copy of the amityville horror... -_-
"watched it, shit da bricks"
meh..
this movie freaked the shit out of me!! but still best horror movie out there..
"i can't even watch this movie is so boring and retarded. make movie really quiet. scare with big loud noise. poor, lazy and uncreative. just like every recent one of its kind. id get more sense of scare by reading an article on the story it's about while drinking my morning coffee."
would be a grate movie if there was more gore and guts flying around
"1: thums this up so the see it 2. click on white area of the page 3. writte 1980 4. wait few second (if nothing shows up type it again) 5. don't save this movie because it's a piece of shit, so unoriginal and boring. i was expecting a decent movie."
"that`s ok, i didnt want to sleep tonight anyways..."
what wtf ?
jule pamplin told me to see this. best movie evar!!!!!!
"... penis... ass... girl... i know what you are saying, man."
isn't the best thriller but it is ok..
nice to watch this at iwantmovies.info
"this traler seems to be full of clich but still intrested :o beside, almsot everything is clich these days, hard to be original, specialy with these kind of movies"
i saw this movie last night awsome movie. but seriously i was too afraid to drive to work ( night shifts)
i wanted to go watch horror for h'ween...lol fuck that ain't gonna happen
"watched this last night. good one for halloween. i have always appreciated the warrens, especially lorraine. i use to watch paranormal state and lorraine would assist at times. she was very good. her faith is inspired."
i could never watch this in a theatre
in my opinion this was a stupid movie
yify ?? :-)
breath taking movie!
hahah
"please, tell me the story of how you became such a bad ass."
"i didn't get a chance to go watch this in theaters....with all the hype and great reviews this movie got, i was anxious to finally watch it a couple of days ago and i seriously don't understand why or how this movie got so many good reviews...people talking about how this movie was ""scary as hell"" this movie was a complete waste of time...i didn't find this movie scary or interesting at all..i can't believe i made it through the whole thing. this was a complete let down"
"hello, halloween!!!"
am i the only one who thinks its weird that this is warner bros?
"all these free movie watching sites.. i paid to watch it on itunes, so. yeah. not hard to make a little money. loljk"
"hurdy gurdy man"" by donovan"
"*16 minutes in and this movie already sucks.* mainstream ""horror"" these days is nothing more than a bunch of rehashed, tired clichs and cheap startles. i'll take any franchise from the 80s over garbage like this any day."
"the conjuring"" 8 me arista to 10. thetika: poli dinato me ipothesi kai orees erminies. entiposiaka efe kai poli kali mousiki. arnitika: poli provlepomeno telos"

i'm too scared to watch this.
"i just saw the movie and no penis this is based on a real story ahaha my ass! i mean just watch it and you will agree with me, a flying chair? flying girl? loll"
need to know how i watched this movie already? after looking at the trailer i stopped to find it on the internet and came across this web site that allows you to stream a variety of movies at no direct cost. i had to get back to share the web site with everybody else who likes this movie trailer. here's the site... watchthesemovies.com
"yifi 4 life,bitch!"
what the fuck?
"the conjuring is scarier, insidious was gay."
"no way, i havn't seen the conjuring yet but oh my god i never get really scared of scary movies but insidious freaked me out so bad, i actually hid the dvd case because i never wanted to look at it again."
i love this song tho... now i'm gonna be scared every time i hear it.
"no, you don't have to. creators of the conjuring are almost same as in insidious and insidious 2, so i think that's the reason why they picked these actors."
"instant classic, instant crush on vera farmiga queen of all milfs"
"no nothing to do ! director james wan and patrick wilson the actor work on both movies, but it's different film entirely and i prefer this movie it's wayyy more scary !"
"hey does this movie have to do anything with insidious? i mean, do you have to watch insidious to watch this one or something? because it doesn't seem like the stories would have anything to do with each other. but actors are the same and it is so confusing!!! please please help me, i have watched insidious but my friend did not and we want to whatch this one, so heeeelp"
this is some scary shit :ooo
"top movie, its bettr dn any other"

oh my wtf
nice
this shits scary as hell!!!
i can sleep off and on now. that laugh is so freaky
are u supposed to laugh at this trailer
i. just. peed.
liked but i actually didn't get so scared wen i saw the movie
"like the trailer? wish you are able to look at the movie? i found a spot on the web where one can simply and securely stream heaps of different hit movies - even this one that is not released yet. their selection is out of this world. they have something for everyone - even my mother! lmao seriously, right here is the web-site url... watchthesemovies.com"
"nope, fuck this. my house is to squeaky to not be traumatised by this moive"
i would get the hell out of that house at the beginning
"the conjuring was one of the greatest scary movies i've ever watched. maybe it was more scary cause me and my friend watched it at 2 a.m. and after it, hmm, i wanted to throw all dolls away o_o"
"looked up the real lorraine warren and now i remember who that lady was :). been hearing a lot about her when i was younger :).i wonder whats what she saw that was extremely bad even though she will never say. maybe her husband knows ed(r.i.p). but good that the real family and lorraine let them make a movie about their story. besides all that, it was an great! movie :)."
i understand this is youtube and you can type whatever you want. but sometimes its good to use commas once in a while. just saying...
"no? i am not wrong, you just misunderstood what i said. but i see what i said that confused you. i know about lorraine and ed warren but mostly lorraine. i was just talking about the real people."
the lady that played the families mother was in the haunting in 1999.
no lorraine was the demonologist. she and ed warren are real. they also investigated the amityville horror. the perrons also were real. ed warren died in 2006.
the final twenty minutes will keep you on your toes.
"can you, now?"
"boring movie... same effects, same plot, cheap camera works. stopped watching 2/3 into the movie. idk could be just me, i'm immune to scary movies. not scary at all... however, i like the clap game that they do, makes it pretty creepy. but overall as a movie it suck."
i just watched this yesterday online and it was so awesome!!!!!!!!!!! bad thing is i couldn't sleep last night...xd but still...great movie!
i and the serius people about horror laughing 30 years whith exorcist except the last 30 minutes now 41 years later i dont expect this movie i thought the truly horror was died but as i say the truly horror begins from now on. amazing movie
the best horror haunting supernatural movie of all times james god bless you man
"far better than i expected! quite a lot of clichs throughout the movie, but the tempo is excellent! you don't have to wait for half of the movie for something to happened. here it's in your face the whole time, with only a few short breaks. watching it alone at night with headphones, adds to the desired effect. :)"
amazing film!! it's right up there with haunting in connecticut (my favourite horror movie) not only is it scary but the story is actually good and not something dumb!! :d
"scariest movie ive ever seen, couldnt sleep for a week."
"james wan has updated image quality of the changeling (1980) + the amityville horror (1979) + the exorcist (1973). if younger people have not seen those films or just do not like classics and are liking this, ok. true story? 1974 ronald defeo shot 6 of his family members. warrens exists. believing in paranormal haunting is your decision."
tip-toe through the tulips with meeeeeee
this film horror qa me pa horror ! :p
"the conjuring is not a blood, guts and gore kind of movie. instead it is a good movie about demonic possession that takes your mind inside the events that occurred to a family, and those that tried to help intervene. be prepared to jump a few times in this intense psychological thriller."
"i recently watched this movie. i would rate the conjuring on the same lines as with the exorcist. both are based on true events about demonic possession. . what's interesting is in both cases the exorcist and the conjuring stories, was the families were never baptized. so being unprotected by the holy spirit. were the families venerable to demonic attack? it would be interesting to know if not being baptized had anything to do with it."
pfff who needs sleep anyway ...
"i'm a spirit posting on youtube. if you don't thumb up my comment, i will hunt you while you are in the middle of fucking some hot chick."
"strong in the force you are. but, then again we are all made up of energy and the physical world is just an illusion (scientific fact)."
just download bitlord (torrent share) and then download the film. i swear by bitlord so much that i dont bother with cable anymore. i simply wait a day or so after a tv show has aired then get it off bitlord (same with dvd releases). plus its pretty safe. they have a gauge on the side of every file which tells you how safe it is. just make sure you pay attention while your downloading bitlord as they will ask if you want extra search bars added to your existing one.

please does anyone have link for watching it online? thanks
hurdy gurdy man by donovan.
an evil spirit must have possessed you..
"true story, like there are ghosts and paranormal spirits wondering around. if there are then i am a jedi knight!!!"

think this trailer was incredibly good? wait until you see the full movie! you can watch it online safely and without cost if you go to this web-site i discovered the other day. i had been surprised at what they have got and just how easy it is to look at all the most recent movies. look at the web-site below! watchthesemovies.com
"hurdy gurdy man donovan, nice song!"
the warrens remind me of robert and rosalind lutece
yes it's based on a true story. the warren's are real people too. there are a few interviews with her on here. the children (now adults) give talks about it. the oldest has written a book about it as well. you can see her talks on here. her name is andrea.
derpy derp
this is based on a true story....but u know....the film usually exhaturate a lil bit xd
watched it yesturday....damn xd
i watched it today. so scary
"there you are, where were you 7 hours ago when i needed you the most ?"
this movie has to win the scream awards !
the grudge is more of a screamer than a psychological horror.
i saw it and it didn't surprise me but this movie did.
"dude i was so disapointed of all the new horror movies with their ugly cg special effect and their repetitive and boring stories but this movie scared the shit out of me thing that didn't happen to me since i was a child, i enjoyed it, it's definitely one of the best horror movies of all time."
you call?
"i saw the movie , fucking scaryy !!"
just bought it at target; am psyched to see it 2nite!!
"you should see ""the grudge""."
i waz even terrified of the trailor let alone the film !!! :o
it was the scariest movie i have ever seen!
"the only way i would go down is if i was doped up on crack, cocaine, heroine, while high from smoking 10 joints, right after i just ate 5 pounds of bath salts...."
"if you watch this without sound it isn't that scary, just a weird movie with people jumping on each other,"
when i saw this there was only like a few scary parts but other than that it's not scary
yeah this is hell scary eah...not!!!
"attention !!!! can anyone answer this, the thing that trips me up the most.... was this really based on real story ?"
bro i suggest you prepare toilet paper...lots of it...
"just started watching now, hope it's good."
